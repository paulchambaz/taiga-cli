what i would like from a robust taiga cli:

# it would be a good idea to parse 

taiga # list all projects
taiga projects # update the projects and list them
taiga login # opens a browser window to connect to taiga and recuperate an api key that will then be stored
taiga project # list the kanban of the project

taiga project new assign:'' desc:'' due:eow +/-team +/-client +/-block card name # creates a new card under the new section

taiga project move card-id new / ready / in-progress / ready-to-test / done / archived # move a card from one section to another
taiga project assign card-id username / me # assign a project to a member / list of members
taiga project name card-id a long description that can be added at the end # add a description to a card
taiga project due card-id eow # add a due date to a project
taiga project team card-id # add a team constrain to a project
taiga project client card-id # add a client constrain to a project
taiga project block card-id # block a card
taiga project modify card-id category:'' @username due:eow +/-team +/-client +/-block new name # do all of those with modify

taiga project category:'' assign:'' due:eow +/-team +/-client +/-block fzf query # query on the project, things are either filters or something else
taiga project search category:'' assign:'' due:eow +/-team +/-client +/-block fzf query # same but with explicit search keyword in case of conflict

taiga project users # list the users in the project
taiga project burndown +username # see the activity of each member (not sure if possible, but would be great)
